* Interactive Web and Mobile User Interface development

  Rapid user interfaces Development and look & feel for Web, Android, iPhone are main
  challenges which needs to be overcome. I overcome these challenges by choosing set of
  tools and programming language that equally works for web, mobile development and
  mastering on it.

  In order to create user experience, I use to work with React and React Native for
  Android and iPhone native UI development. I have adopted functional style of
  programming with immutable data structure (Redux, GrapthQL) to manage complex UI interaction,
  transition animation and real time notifications and messaging as well as keep
  the code always manageable for further development.

  CSS, HTML5, SVG, Canvas are essential part of UI look & feet and also
  for make the UI responsive but one need to take special care when using these
  technologies spatially when using CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries.
  Which often makes website bulky slower loading time and slower response time.
  I used dead code elimination techniques using google Clojure compiler so that
  web site never gets bulky.

  Data Visualization info graphics is very important part of user interface design
  its empower user so that user can understand whole business case at a glance.
  I use d3 and Vega as well as mathematics when convenient for demographics.

* Concurrent and fault tolerant Application Development for Web and Internet of things (IOT)

  Rise of cloud infrastructure and IOT devices make us thinking of current monolithic
  application architecture. Estimated number of IOT devices will connect to web by 2020
  will be 5 times total population of the earth; on the other hand in order to leverage cloud
  infrastructure application needs to be concurrent, fault tolerant and distributed.
  I use to work with immutable data structure because data mutation is a serious problem
  for multi thread environment which causes deadlock and data loss and frequent crashing
  and current solution semaphore locking and mutes doesn’t guaranties to avoid these circumstances.
  I use communication sequential processing (CPS) to effective message passing between the threads
  which can leverage thousands of threads over the cloud.

  Micro services are necessary part of cloud infrastructure which leverage heterogeneous
  programming languages work together. I have implemented Micro services with java, nodes,
  python, clojure, c/c++ using by exposing Rest service and JSON data structure to
  subscriber and Message Queues for real time notification. We had tough time ensuring
  height availability and redundancy of micro services and update code one production server.
  I am working on GraphQL, datalog, logic programming,  Erlang error handling mechanism to solve
  the problems.
* Embedded System for Internet of things (IOT).

  Embedded System knowledge is must to join raise of IOT and System on Chip (SoC).
  I stated my carrier in embedded system, difference between now and then is -
  there is sufficient information available online and large number of PCB vendors,
  even cost of making prototype is reasonable. I have done projects on  ESP32,
  ESP8266 form PCB design to production no not mention I was in device driver team
  for multimedia communication system based on Linux kernel where I need
  to fix device related bugs and communication protocol related bugs. Only difficulties
  I faced  now and then is a non technical issues of customs dispatching overhead,
  courier services charges but we have our way to overcome these issues.

* Distributed database design and Query optimization

I worked with Relational Databases - oracle and postgre and implemented sql quries and stored
  procedure with large set of telecommunication data witch had over ten million subscribers.
  I have found it even takes days to complete a query when data volume gets this size.
  Implementing Redis Cluster solve this problem because data stays memory use disk for persistence
  but it loose the ability to SQL over database. Finally we came out optimal data base which only only
  leverage SQL query but also can query graph database and document query at the same time efficiently
  use Redis Clusters.

* Devops System Automation, testing and writing specs

  Fix a bug may introduce other bugs that why unit testing is very necessary to protect
  overall integrity of the product from new change request. But it takes significant
  amount time to write test cases not to mention some time we got reluctant and cover
  every edge cases. I have introduced property base testing along with software specification
  language so that test case can be auto generated.

  Finally system automation is necessary, because it is nature of human to make mistake
  and human learns from mistake. On the other hand machine breaks on error. In order
  to feel this gap and keep whole system up and running from development to production
  and maintenance we need to automate whole system with best practices and proven tactics
  and keep it out of human intervention. This is why I use to work with linux over windows
  to implement policy based devops systems and UI using Python, Javascirpt, AWK,
  Shell scripting over the cloud architecture and build cloud architecture using Xen,
  Docker and virtual desktop.
* Education - BSC, Computer science from AIUB

  I have a solid academic background, I have participated programming contests and
  perform quite well. My final project was - Design 32-bit processor using MISPs
  instruction on Xlink FPGA
